# Task Management System

This project is a full-stack web application built as a learning project to explore and gain experience with Angular, C#, and .NET technologies. It provides a simple task management system where users can create, organize, and track their tasks.

## Key Features
- **Frontend**: Built with Angular 19 using Material Design components  
- **Backend**: REST API built with ASP.NET Core 9.0  
- **Database**: SQL Server with Entity Framework Core for data persistence  
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI integration for API exploration  

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Angular, TypeScript, SCSS  
- **Backend**: C#, ASP.NET Core, Entity Framework Core  
- **Database**: SQL Server  
- **Tools**: Swagger, Angular CLI, .NET CLI  

## Project Structure
The project is divided into two main components:  
1. **Frontend**: Angular application (see `Frontend/README.md` for setup instructions)  
2. **Backend**: ASP.NET Core Web API (see `Backend/Program.cs` for API configuration)  

## Learning Objectives
This project was developed primarily as a learning exercise to:  
- Understand Angular's component-based architecture  
- Explore .NET Core's Web API capabilities  
- Practice implementing RESTful APIs  
- Learn about CORS configuration and API security  
- Gain experience with Entity Framework Core and database migrations
